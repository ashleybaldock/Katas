## Install/run

```
npm install && cd client && npm install
npm run startDev
```

Should be all you need, this will run the main server process, drone sim and UI. Access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000

./drones.js  - Simple drone simulation to feed data into server
./client     - react app client
./sockets.js - socketio config
./server.js  - express entry point
./app.js     - main server entry point


## Assumptions and notes
Assumptions based on initial challenge:
- Number of drones: I'm going to assume this is in the range of tens to hundreds, rather than thousands to millions (since the latter would involve much more focus on scalability)
- Drones generally stay within the geographical area of the UK (I'm not going to worry too much about edge cases calculating distances around the poles, for example)
- Location accuracy is determined by general GPS location accuracy, i.e. realistic minimal resolution on the order of 3-5m (I'm going to assume the drones have some much more precise
  form of navigational control internally, and that they're reporting geographic-scale information for tracking purposes) - the resolution of the data is thus in the order of meters
- The drones report only location information at regular intervals, from which their (average) velocity can be determined
- Real-time tracking delay is set at 1s, with the drones reporting their position every 1s. This would be configurable in a real-world system based on user need/bandwidth tradeoff.
- No need to store telemetry, only real-time state in-memory. Need two location fixes to determine velocity however
  - In a real-world system I'd probably design this so that the drones reported their own internal idea of their velocity, rather than calculating it on the server-side based on geo-fixes,
    since that would be more accurate. Or store a history of location fixes and display a moving average of the drone's recent velocity.
- Unique ID assumed to be generated by the drone, I'm going to use a UUID
  - It'd be good to optimise/cache this into a separate WebSocket call (e.g. on connect) so it isn't sent with every location update, to further save on bandwidth
- Location assumed to be decimal lat/lng tuple

Dashboard needs to highlight drones which haven't moved more than 1m in the past 10 seconds, so we need to keep some measure of history for the drones' locations.

Technical decisions:
- Dashboard as a simple React app
- Single API endpoint, use websockets for this too since the data is being updated in realtime
- Nodejs server handling websocket connections from drones and the dashboard (in reality, I might split these into two microservices depending on scale)

Dashboard needs to display:
- Drone's unique ID
- Last location
- Current speed (in m/s and km/h)
- Visual highlight for drones which aren't moving very much (they should display in red)

I chose to use WebSockets as the protocol for the drones reporting their position - this has much lower bandwidth overhead than plain HTTP for regular small updates of information. In a realistic implementation it might not be optimal (you could improve on it by using a custom protocol based on TCP specifically designed to minimise data transfer, for example).
I haven't implemented any security, since that didn't seem to be a focus in the challenge description, but this kind of system would ideally be secured against tampering with the telemetry from the drones, a simple way to implement this would be client certificate based auth for the drones and securing the websocket connections with TLS. The frontend/backend communication could also be easily wrapped in TLS and some kind of authentication mechanism for the API endpoint.
